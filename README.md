ABC Company operates an e-commerce platform and processes thousands of orders daily. To deliver these orders, ABC has partnered with several courier companies in India, which charge them based on the weight of the products and the distance between the warehouse and the customer’s delivery address. ABC wants to check if the fees charged by the courier companies for each order are correct.
In addition, ABC must apply the logic of calculating charges based on the slab weight, delivery area and type of shipment listed on the courier company’s invoice. The courier fee rate card provides a fixed fee and an additional fee for each weight plate and PIN. The total charge per shipment should be calculated by adding the fixed charge and any additional charges based on plate weight.
