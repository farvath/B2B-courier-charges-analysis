# B2B-courier-charges-analysis
ABC Company operates an e-commerce platform and processes thousands of orders daily. To deliver these orders, ABC has partnered with several courier companies in India, which charge them based on the weight of the products and the distance between the warehouse and the customer’s delivery address. ABC wants to check if the fees charged by the courier companies for each order are correct.
In addition, ABC must apply the logic of calculating charges based on the slab weight, delivery area and type of shipment listed on the courier company’s invoice. The courier fee rate card provides a fixed fee and an additional fee for each weight plate and PIN. The total charge per shipment should be calculated by adding the fixed charge and any additional charges based on plate weight.
# About the dataset:
ABC has internal data split across three reports: Website Order Report, Master SKU, and Warehouse PIN for all India Pincode mappings. In addition, they receive billing data from courier companies.
The website order report includes order IDs and products (SKUs) for each order. The SKU master provides the gross weight of each product, which is needed to calculate the total weight of each order. Courier company invoices contain information such as AWB number, order ID, shipment weight, warehouse pickup PIN, customer delivery PIN, delivery area, the charge per shipment and type of shipment.
